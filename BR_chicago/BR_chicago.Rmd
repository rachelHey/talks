## Ranking based on Averages - not optimal

Easily computed and communicated, but 

* **-** The effect of COIs and other abstentions seems arbitrary!  
* **-** Highly influenced by outliers: Reviewer or Panel effect.  
* **-** What is a meaningful difference? It depends…


## Possible solution: Bayesian Ranking combined with Lottery


- Let's assume that  $y_{ij}$ is the estimation of the quality of proposal $i$ by voter $j$.

- Bayesian Hierarchical Model (given some priors) for the panel votes:
$$y_{ij} \ | \ \theta_i, \lambda_{ij} \sim  N(\bar{y} + \theta_i + \lambda_{ij}, \sigma^2)$$
  $$\theta_i  \sim  N(0, \tau^2_{\theta})$$
  
  $$\lambda_{ij}  \sim  N(\nu_j, \tau^2_{\lambda})$$
  
  
<br> 

- Then, we extract the **distribution of the rank of the $\theta_i$** to achieve the Bayesian Ranking.


## Funding Recommendation {.smaller data-background="Figure_br.png"}

## Funding Recommendation 
Group  | Count | Percentage
--| -- | --
Accepted | 100 | 28%
Random selection | 12 | 4%
Rejected | 241 | 68%


## Bayesian Ranking adapted by the SNSF and fully integrated in process in Fall 2022

Main Lesson learned: 

- Panel members fear to lose power of decision making (to an algorithm)
    - present BR results as recommendations
    - focus on transparent communication:
      - Methodology implemented in an `R`-package available on github 
        [ERforResearch](https://github.com/snsf-data/ERforResearch)
      - Scientific publication available now from _Statistics and Public Policy_
       [DOI: 10.1080/2330443X.2022.2086190](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2330443X.2022.2086190)
