## Simple ranking based on averages - not optimal

Easily computed and communicated, but 

* **-** The effect of COIs and other abstentions seems arbitrary!  
* **-** Highly influenced by outliers: Reviewer or Panel effect.  
* **-** What is a meaningful difference? It depends…

<br>

* We need a method that
* $\rightarrow$ allows to split scientific evaluation and funding decision 
<!-- (no biased funding$line discussions) -->
* $\rightarrow$ define the funding line and a lottery group in a consistent, transparent and reproducible way



## Possible solution: Bayesian Ranking combined with Lottery


- Let's assume that  $y_{ij}$ is the estimation of the quality of proposal $i$ by voter $j$.

- Bayesian Hierarchical Model (given some priors) for the panel votes:
$$y_{ij} \ | \ \theta_i, \lambda_{ij} \sim  N(\bar{y} + \theta_i + \lambda_{ij}, \sigma^2)$$
  $$\theta_i  \sim  N(0, \tau^2_{\theta})$$
  
  $$\lambda_{ij}  \sim  N(\nu_j, \tau^2_{\lambda})$$
  
  
<br> 

- Then, we extract the **distribution of the rank of the $\theta_i$** to achieve the Bayesian Ranking.


## Funding Recommendation {.smaller data-background="Figure_br.png"}
<br>

- 28% accepted (100)  
 **4% in lottery (12)**  
 68% rejected (241)  


## Pros and cons of Bayesian Ranking

- **+** Quantify uncertainty with respect to the true rank  
  **+** Truly comparative ranking  
  **+** Adjust for grading habits of panel members (and possible of panels)

<br> <br>

- **-** Higher complexity  
  **-** Longer and intense computation needed


## Bayesian Ranking adopted by the SNSF and fully integrated in process in Fall 2022

**Lessons learned** 

- Bayesian Ranking is a (still imperfect) decision making tool
- Limitations and assumptions need to be clearly communicated
- Developement and implementation process needs to be communicated transparently and all panel members should be included in discussion ($e.g$ no black box)  

- Methodology implemented in `R`-package available on github [ERforResearch](https://github.com/snsf-data/ERforResearch)
